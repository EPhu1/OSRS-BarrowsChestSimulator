# OSRS-BarrowsChestSimulator

I made this reward chest simulator for a video game called Old School Runescape. I used to play this game a lot growing up. I always loved testing my luck with this rewards chest,
so I made this simple web application to precisely simulate the loot mechanic. I used Javascript, HTML, and CSS to create this simple application. I used this 
https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/comments/5x5jq7/barrows_chance_for_multiple_loot_explained/ as the math behind my application. My program implements mathemetical concepts such as Bernoulli 
probability to accurately replicate the loot mechanics.
